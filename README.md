This project joins two world that already share a lot of use in common, but they aren't fully integrated: Action cameras and smartphones. To accomplish this target, I've used the processing capacities of the new generation smartphones, their telemetry sensors and their network connections The result is an application that connects automatically to a RTSP camera, gets the video stream, stores the smartphone's telemetry in real time and finally, composes a video that joins the video with the movement of the mobile phone.

This is personal project made in Kotlin for Android devices that I made to learn how to use sensors, play a little bit with video integration using OpenCV and practice with the software architecture of an Android application.

The code is widely commented but additional documentation and a video can be found in: http://openaccess.uoc.edu/webapps/o2/handle/10609/126628 (Spanish).
